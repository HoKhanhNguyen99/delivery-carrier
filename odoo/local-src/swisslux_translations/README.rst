Swisslux Specific Translations
==============================

Define translations for official modules that we want to overwrite.

Using a new module only for translation permits to avoid having po files
with hand made translations that could disapear on next translation update
of the module.

As deleted terms are not present in po files, someone could think those specific terms
has disapeard if he isn't aware those are for another module.
