@upgrade_from_9.0.12
Feature: upgrade to 9.0.13

  Scenario: upgrade
    Given I update the module list
    Given I install the required modules with dependencies:
      | name                                          |
      | specific_product                              |
      | mrp_bom_dismantling                           |
      | specific_reports                              |
      | specific_building_project                     |
    Then my modules should have been installed and models reloaded
    Then I set the version of the instance to "9.0.13"
